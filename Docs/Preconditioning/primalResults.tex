% Jesse's part

%Poisson, variable diffusion (high contrast?) Poisson, reaction diffusion 
%Stokes?  Compare/contrast Helmholtz for primal vs ultra weak.  
%Discuss dependence on overlap region (vertex/face/no overlap). 
%Automatically adapted meshes 
%Coarse solve: AMG?s performance for P1 DPG (vs P1 FEM)
%Convection?  P-multigrid, line Jacobi
