- Remove 2x startup cost for primal DPG by locally interping to higher order only 
- Speed up local solve by using parpool/parfor, avoid kron

Preconditioners to try
1. ideal block preconditioner (invert blocks exactly)
2. (O)AS + coarse P1 (interp to N=1 space) 

classical OAS:  high-order elements, matrix blocks with overlap, coarse space preconditioner involving linear vertex modes for all elements.

3. AGMG 
4. nodal dpg-fem preconditioner (AGMG?)

Take all nodes from all elements (ignoring redundancy), triangulate (delauney)
and then form an operator the same size as the original system but with increased sparsity. 
Then proceed with this as a preconditioner using say AGMG
