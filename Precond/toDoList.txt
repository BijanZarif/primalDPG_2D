- Remove 2x startup cost for primal DPG by locally interping to higher order only 
- Speed up local solve by using parpool/parfor, avoid kron

Preconditioners to try
1. ideal block preconditioner (invert blocks exactly)
2. (O)AS + coarse P1 (interp to N=1 space) classical OAS:  high-order elements, matrix blocks with overlap, coarse space preconditioner.
3. GMG + P1 AGMG 
4. nodal dpg-fem preconditioner - take all nodes from all elements (ignoring redundancy), triangulate (delauney), and then form an operator the same size as the original system but with increased sparsity.
